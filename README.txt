Materializer is a set of Material Design Components for WordPress. Powered by simple short-codes, Materializer includes everything you need to add Material Design to your site.

== Description ==

= Getting Started =

Thanks for installing! Let me show you around:

**Documentation:**

- All of the documentation can be found at [The documentation page](http://codyreichert.github.io/materializer)

= Quickstart =

Materializer comes with over 25 different Material Design components
and hundreds of ways to customize them. To get a good idea of how it all
works, add this short-code to your page after installing the plugin:


> [card title="A Cool Card!" text="text-darken-3 grey" title_color="blue"]
>   I am a very simple card. I am good at containing mall bits of
>   information. I am convenient because I require little markup to use
>   effectively.
>   [link text="blue" to="/"]Go Home[/link]
> [/card]


The short-code above gives a material design *card*, of which you can
control the title, background color, text color, and link color. This
is just one of many ways you can use and combine short-codes.
